This is a banking software that shows how much money you will gain after investing it for x amount of years.
the user decides how long, how often, and how much money will go into their account.
The program then outputs how much they will have in their set time.

I did the logic side of this quite well. I am very into crypto currencies and I do the logic behind this software
quite frequently. I am proud of what in this software. I could enchance the layout of the code however. I think
it could be improved to look more simple and cleaner looking back on it. I always take a break when I get frustated
during this project the output kept moving over a few lines however after some trial and error I added a /t to fix it.
The logic behind this will be carried over to every project I do as the skill set does not change only the end result.

Best,
Steve
